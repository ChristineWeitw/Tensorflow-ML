# Tensorflow-ML

This repository contains machine learning models implemented in TensorFlow to solve the tasks of "machine learning with Python certification" from freecodecamp.

# Models
1. [LinearRegression](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/LinearRegression.py): the dataset we will be focusing on here is the titanic dataset. It has tons of information about each passenger on the ship. Our final goal is to predict how likely can a passenger survive at the end.
2. [Classification](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/Classification.py): the dataset we will be using here is the iris flower dataset. We will be using some flower properties information to predict which type is the flower.
3. [Hidden Markov](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/HiddenMarkov.py): the Hidden Markiv Model works with probabilities to predict future events or states. In this section, we will show how to create a hidden markov model that can predict the weather.
4. [Neural Network](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/NN.py): for this section we will use the MNIST Fashion Datasets. This datasets include 60,000 images(28*28 pixels) for training and 10,000 for testing. Our labels are integers rangin g from 0-9. Each integer represents a specific article of clothing.
5. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/CNN.ipynb):The problem we will consider here is classifying 10 different everyday objects. The dataset we will use is built into tf and called the "CIFAR Image Dataset". It contains 60,000 32*32 color images with 6000 images of each class. The labels in this dataset are the following: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck. 
6. [Natural Language Processing With RNNs](https://github.com/ChristineWeitw/Tensorflow-ML/blob/master/NLP_using_RNN_SentimentAnalysis_PlayGenerator.ipynb):in this section, we demonstrate how to do Sentiment Analysis and Create a play generator using NLP.
